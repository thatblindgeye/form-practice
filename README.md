# Accessible Form

## Description
This is another mini-project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The form has fields for an email, country, zip code, password, and password confirmation.

The form has ARIA attributes in order to make it accessible to screen readers. This feature needs to be tested, but the goal is for a screen reader to announce when an error dialogue has appeared either upon leaving an input field or upon pressing the submit button.

## How To Use
Simply fill out the form fields, following any instructions that are listed. If a field does not meet the requirements, an error dialogue will appear below the field, explaining how to fix the error (if there are no instructions below the field) or simply stating that the field contents is not valid.
